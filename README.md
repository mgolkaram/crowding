# crowding
Inhomogenous Stochastic Simulation Algorithm with crowded environment. 
User can define different reactions occuring in an amorphous strucutre in which particles are constrained to diffuse through.
Applications:
- Gene Expression in Crowded Environment.
- Motor Protein Motion in Crowded Environment.
